## Overview

As per the assignment brief set out by the lecturer, this program aims to provide an automated testing 
framework by parsing Java files and automatically creating relevant tests.

Because this is a developmental assignment with no set *gold standard* to measure against, the 
following features have been implemented in this submission: 

* Parse Java file  automatically to obtain a list of methods and their parameters
* Parse Java file automatically to obtain a list of if branches and their conditions
* Generate values for meeting Restricted MCDC Coverage Criterion.
* Generate test cases automatically and parse to a java test file


## Technologies
* Java - JDK Version 11
