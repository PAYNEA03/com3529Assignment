Get passed class and turn it into a string file that can be parsed to get all the conditions flagging them for instrumentation. Then take that string file and create another new version of it that can then be ran by our program which finds all the conditions it needs to fill the coverage criteria, adding those inputs to a Map which holds all the inputs as well as the output. Then we take that set of inputs and desired outputs and push that through a method which creates a JUnit test suite for each input/output collection. This JUnit test suite is for the original class not the instrumented replica we've created. 

Additionally java reflection from software re-engineering can be used to get all this information like the fields and parameters the methods use to get the set of all the input for each method (using MethodNode and iterating through the instructions)
